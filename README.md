# Stats-101A-Film-Revenue-Prediction-Model
Developed a Multiple Linear Regression model in R using a Kaggle dataset of 500+ films to predict gross box office revenues based on film attributes like budget, runtime, ratings, and viewer count. Applied box-cox and log transformations to correct skewed distributions, and addressed multicollinearity using VIF and Stepwise Selection.
